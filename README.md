# Art Gallery Management System

A full-stack database web application for managing an art gallery. Built as a showcase of relational database design and SQL, the system models a real gallery's data — artwork, artists, customers, staff, and sales — and exposes it through three role-based web interfaces.

## Overview

The application is backed by a **PostgreSQL** relational database and served by a **FastAPI** backend. All data access uses raw SQL (no ORM) to demonstrate query design across joins, aggregations, filters, and pagination. The frontend is plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with **Chart.js** for data visualizations.

On first launch, a seed script automatically populates the database with realistic simulated data:

| Table | Count |
|---|---|
| Gallery | 1 (The Meridian Art Gallery) |
| Artists | 300 |
| Customers | 5,000 |
| Artwork | 3,000 |
| Staff | 15 |
| Likes | ~15,000 |
| Handles | ~200 |

## Relational Schema

```
Customers(customerID, name, phoneNum, email, moneySpent)
Artists(artistID, name, style, medium)
Artwork(artworkID, title, yearMade, style, price, isSold, artistID→Artists, galleryID→Gallery)
Staff(staffID, name, phoneNum, role, galleryID→Gallery)
Gallery(galleryID, name, address, openHours)
Like(customerID→Customers, artworkID→Artwork, artistID→Artists)
Handles(staffID→Staff, artworkID→Artwork)
```

## Interfaces

### Visitor Page (`/`)
Browse the gallery's full collection. Filter artwork by style, price range, and availability. View all artists sorted by style. Includes four Chart.js charts: artwork count by style, sold vs. available breakdown, artwork distribution by year, and price range histogram.

### Staff Page (`/staff.html`)
Select an active staff member to view and manage their assigned artwork. Mark pieces as sold, unassign artwork, add new artwork to the gallery, and assign existing pieces. Includes a searchable read-only customer lookup table.

### Management Page (`/management.html`)
Full CRUD management for all entities (Artwork, Artists, Customers, Staff) in a tabbed layout with inline edit/delete modals. An Analytics tab displays six charts: revenue by style, top customers by spending, top artists by artwork count, staff assignment distribution, most-liked artists, and artwork added by year.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Database | PostgreSQL 15 |
| Backend | Python 3.11, FastAPI, psycopg2 |
| Package manager | uv |
| Seed data | Faker |
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| Charts | Chart.js 4 |
| Containerization | Docker + Docker Compose |

## Setup & Running

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed and running.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DarwinWhite/csce_608_art_gallery_management_system.git
cd csce608_project
```

### 2. Start the application

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will:
1. Pull the `postgres:15` image and start the database.
2. Build the backend image (installs all Python dependencies via `uv`).
3. Apply the schema (`database/schema.sql`) to the database automatically.
4. Start the FastAPI server, which seeds the database on first launch (takes ~1–2 minutes).

### 3. Open the app

Once you see `Seeding complete.` in the logs, open your browser:

| Interface | URL |
|---|---|
| Visitor | http://localhost:8000 |
| Staff | http://localhost:8000/staff.html |
| Management | http://localhost:8000/management.html |
| API docs (Swagger) | http://localhost:8000/docs |

### Stopping

```bash
docker compose down
```

The database volume (`postgres_data`) is preserved between restarts. On subsequent `docker compose up` runs, seeding is skipped automatically.

To fully reset the database (wipe all data):

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
